Task 2: Image Encryption Tool

Author: B S Namith Kumar
Track: Cybersecurity
Internship: SkillCraft Technology

Summary:
This Python script encrypts and decrypts images using two simple techniques:

1. Pixel Swapping: Each pixel swaps position with its neighbor, creating a visually distorted version of the image. Decryption reverses the process.
2. Mathematical Transformation: A fixed constant is added to the pixel values (modulo 256). This too is fully reversible.

Learnings:
- Pixel-level manipulation using NumPy and PIL
- Understanding how simple transformations can obscure visual data
- Writing clean, interactive CLI tools using argparse
- Structuring Python projects for clarity and reusability
